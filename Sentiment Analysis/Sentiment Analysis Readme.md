# Sentiment Analysis

This directory focuses on implementing sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset. The following steps are covered:

1. **Building a Frequency Dictionary** - Counts occurrences of positive and negative words.
2. **Logistic Regression for Sentiment Classification** - A simple model to classify tweets as positive or negative.
3. **Visualization** - Scatter plot visualization of word frequencies and logistic regression results.

## Files:

- `build_freqs.py`: Builds a frequency dictionary from the dataset.
- `logistic_regression.py`: Implements logistic regression for sentiment analysis.
- `word_frequency_visualization.py`: Creates scatter plots to visualize word distributions and decision boundaries.
