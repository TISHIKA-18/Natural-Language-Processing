# NLP Specialization Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises related to my journey through an NLP specialization. The focus is on practical implementation of text processing and sentiment analysis, specifically using Twitter datasets.

Each directory contains code and documentation of the steps involved in the NLP pipeline, from preprocessing raw text data to building and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment analysis.
